# Cancer_Detection
DataSet with 32 columns and 592 rows.
it was impossible to see important faetures among 32 given fetaures so i performed dimensionality reduction to perform feature reduction
then after getting relevant fetaures, data was split into train and test
 logisctic regression algorithm is applied
later accuracy of the result is being check which came out to be 94.8%
